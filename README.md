### Results:
#### Ad source marketing investment optimization
The results of the step 1 have shown that Yandex.Afisha had three times more monthly potential customers among desktop users, around 15000 users compared to only 5000 of touch users. In June 2020 the majority of potential customers (around 8000) came from the 4th ad source, but only 18% of the marketing budget was spent on this source. As mentioned before the company spent ~42% of its marketing budget on the 3rd source, but each month it attracted less users than the 4th source. The revenue of the 4th ad source was 34375.06$, which is 4000 more than that of the 3rd source. The revenue of 2nd and 5th sources is also not that different from that of the 3rd source, but they were invested much less money. Company should optimize its marketing expenditure by decreasing 3rd ad sources' investments and probably increasing 4th, 5th and 2nd sources investments.<br>
The 1st ad source is also worth mentioning, it attracted only 1000-4000 users monthly but brought ~28000 amount of revenue which is nearly the same as the 3rd source. However it only had 6% of total marketing investments which is 1/7 of the 3rd ad source. The 1st source should be receiving at least twice more investments.
#### ROI
The analysis has shown that the 3rd ad source was very unprofitable. The 9th and 10th ad sources on the contrary have demonstrated quite encouraging results. If company had spent more money on these sources, it would have probably made more revenue in the end. The 1st source is also quite encouraging.
#### Platform choice
The results have shown that users prefer desktop version of the product which probably means that touch version has some technical problems. May be touch version of Yandex.Afisha should be improved.
#### Sales
Number of orders made by one cohort during a given period of time shows that customers of the cohorts were not as loyal as the company would like to expect. Number of orders dropped after first month and it is true for each cohorts, none of them have shown any growth. But the customers who stayed loyal acquired more products since the average number of orders per customer was increasing, especially for the first cohort. As for the revenue, each cohort has shown some success over the time but overall the revenue dropped by the end of the last lifetime.
